How to run it: you need to run it with gpp with this command after you compile it yourself do:
g++ -o game game.cpp

Basically your charectar is the little amongus icon and each of the charectars represent a tile.
You move around with wasd and pressing enter, I wanted to keep it to as basic pure c++ as I could.
When you make contact with a tile it will delete the tile.
If you have any questions on how any of it works feel free to ask me, I was possibly thinking of adapting it to a full game when I get the time.
